After a few design sessions my frolleague <a href="http://jeannebataille.com">Jeanne Bataille</a> — who, by the way, also contributed to the design of this site — came up a concept revolving around overlapping color plains. This would be the starting point for the identity of the website.</p>\n<h3>My role</h3>\n<p>Once the concept was established my main responsibility was setting up the website environment and building the front-end.</p>\n<h3>Challenges</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges in this project was getting the overlapping color areas to work. The aim was to get a <code>multiply</code> effect using <code>blend modes</code> in CSS. This, at the time, was a very new technique that was not supported in many browsers. Therefore we chose for a <code>progressive enhancement</code> path where people with modern browser could see this feature. Visitors of the website with older not-supported browser would, in turn, see a more basic version of the site.</p>\n<h4>Tech specs</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>KirbyCMS / CraftCMS</li>\n<li>CSS3 animations</li>\n<li>GreenSock JS</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Awards</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Site of the Day (Awwwards)</li>\n<li>CSS design awards</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="https://www.bolden.nl">https://www.bolden.nl</a></p>',frontmatter:{date:"August 06, 2018",path:"/projects/bolden",title:"Bolden",subtitle:"A digital agency portfolio website"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
