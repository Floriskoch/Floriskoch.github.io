When I was working at [https://www.bolden.nl](https://www.bolden.nl) I contributed to a cool and important project for the Dutch branch of Friend of the Earth. The goal was to show what the oil-company Shell says they do in the media, and what they actually do in the real world on one timeline. Although this sounds like an easy task, to visually connect various events and publications within a timeline is quite complicated.

### Challenges
UX design was a major challenge in this project. The first challenge was to visually connect various events and publications on the timeline. We achieved this using visual elements like lines and icons. The second challenge was how to present the visitor of the site with additional information about a specific event or publication. We went for a solution where the extra information was dynamically loaded with AJAX in an overlay when the user clicked on a timeline item.

#### Tech specs
- KirbyCMS
- CSS3 animations
- GreenSock JS
- Ajax (asynchronous loading)
