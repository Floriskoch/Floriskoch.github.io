Waarzitwatin is a website — initiated by various Dutch government organisations — informing the general public about the safety of consumer products and the substances in them. The main goal that had to be achieved with this project was informing the public in a fun but very accessible way.

### Technical challenges
To make the website compliant to the web content accessibility guidelines we addressed several issues such as: make the website navigable by keyboard, increase contrast between colors to improve legibility and do lots of user testing to ensure that all information on the site was easy to find.

### My role
My role in this project was focused on back-end issues (e.g. building plugins for OctoberCMS to fit this websites' needs). I worked in close collaboration with the front-ender to deliver a good end result.

#### Tech specs:
- PHP7 / Laravel 5 / OctoberCMS
- Javascript (ES6) / SASS / Twig
