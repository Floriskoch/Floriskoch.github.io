### New company website
When I was working at Bolden, an Amsterdam based digital agency, me and two colleagues were asked to come up with a design for the new company website. After a few design sessions my frolleague [Jeanne Bataille](http://jeannebataille.com) — who, by the way, also contributed to the design of this site — came up a concept revolving around overlapping color plains. This would be the starting point for the identity of the website.

### My role
Once the concept was established my main responsibility was setting up the website environment and building the front-end.

### Challenges
One of the biggest challenges in this project was getting the overlapping color areas to work. The aim was to get a `multiply` effect using `blend modes` in CSS. This, at the time, was a very new technique that was not supported in many browsers. Therefore we chose for a `progressive enhancement` path where people with modern browser could see this feature. Visitors of the website with older not-supported browser would, in turn, see a more basic version of the site.
