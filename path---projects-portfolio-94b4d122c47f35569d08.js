Using Gatbsy has several advantages for content sites like these. First of all, there is no need for a back-end / database to store data. All dynamic content on this site, like this article, is stored in Markdown files which are easily editable in a text editor. Second, the template files are written in ReactJS, a JavaScript front-end framework developed by Facebook.</p>\n<p>When I deploy this site to GitHub Pages the Gatsby engine takes the data from the markdown files, injects it into the React templates and renders out static HTML, JS and other asset files, and consequently uploads them to GitHub.</p>\n<p>I choose this platform because I wanted to learn more about static site generators, ReactJS and GraphQL. My experience with these technologies has been positive so far and I look forward to working with them more often in the future.</p>\n<h4>Tech specs:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>GatsbyJS / ReactJS / GraphQL</li>\n<li>Sass</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="https://waarzitwatin.nl">https://waarzitwatin.nl</a></p>',frontmatter:{date:"August 08, 2018",path:"/projects/portfolio",title:"Portfolio site",subtitle:"This website is built on GatsbyJS"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
